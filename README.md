Realization of some Error detecting codes:
- Parity control
- Vertical and horizontal parity control
- CRC-24 (Polynomial: 100001100100110011111011)

For calculating checksum you need to choose method and input filename, after calculating you can input another filename and compare it checksum with previously calculated.
